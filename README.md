# pyExeSMS
Simple Python GUI for sending SMS messages through the Exetel SMS API

This program doesn't include the address book, message history or
other advanced features of the official Java-based eXeSMS program,
but the Java-based program stopped working for me recently and has
been unsupported for several years.

If you need the advanced stuff, it's all available on the Exetel site
at https://www.exetel.com.au/myexetel/sms/view_sms_over_web anyway.
